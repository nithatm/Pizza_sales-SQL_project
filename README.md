This project involves analyzing pizza sales data from a shop using SQL to uncover insights and trends. The dataset contains detailed information on pizza types, sales volume, pricing, order time, and customer demographics. Through SQL queries, the project investigates key performance indicators such as total sales, top-selling pizzas, sales by time of day, and customer preferences. The analysis helps identify peak sales periods, customer ordering habits, and menu items contributing the most to revenue. These insights can be leveraged to optimize inventory, refine pricing strategies, and enhance marketing efforts, ultimately driving increased profitability for the pizza shop.
